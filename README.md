# Project1_ProfilePage
This was my first project that I did in my Foundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript bootcamp.  We had to create a profile website that included an audio, images and hyperlinks. The images and audio file were located in different folders than the .html file, which is why they are not included.
